# Worked examples

Three complete, start-to-finish runs on real targets:

1. [**libxml2 + a libFuzzer harness**](#1-libxml2--a-libfuzzer-harness-cc) — the
   C/C++ path, with static-library expansion and an indirect error callback.
2. [**The `url` crate + a ziggy harness**](#2-the-url-crate--a-ziggy-harness-rust)
   — the Rust path, rooted at the Rust `main`.
3. [**rustyknife + a cargo-afl harness**](#3-rustyknife--a-cargo-afl-harness-rust)
   — the Rust manual route, for a feature-gated AFL bin.

The exact counts below come from real runs (LLVM 22, type-based backend); yours
will vary with library version, build flags, and LLVM release.

## 1. libxml2 + a libFuzzer harness (C/C++)

Take [libxml2-2.9.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanhauser-thc/fuzzing-targets/refs/heads/master/libxml2-2.9.2.tar.gz)
and a small C++ libFuzzer harness, and compute which libxml2 functions the
harness can reach. This exercises three features at once:

- **C/C++ acquisition** — building with the gllvm wrappers to get bitcode.
- **Static-library expansion** — analyzing *all* of `libxml2.a`, not just the
  parts the harness pulls in (`--static-libs`).
- **Indirect-call resolution** — the harness installs an error callback, and the
  analyzer reaches it through a function pointer.

The harness (`harness.cc`):

```cpp
#include "libxml/parser.h"

void ignore(void *ctx, const char *msg, ...) {
  // Error handler to silence libxml2 parser messages.
}

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const unsigned char *data, size_t size) {
    xmlSetGenericErrorFunc(NULL, &ignore);
    auto doc = xmlReadMemory(reinterpret_cast<const char *>(data), size,
                             "noname.xml", NULL, 0);
    if (doc) {
        xmlFreeDoc(doc);
        xmlCleanupParser();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Prerequisites

A built analyzer and `gllvm` on `PATH` — see the README
[Install](../README.md#install) section. In short:

```bash
export REACHABILITY_ANALYZER=$PWD/analyzer/build/reachability-analyzer
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"     # gclang / gclang++ / get-bc
source .venv/bin/activate
reachability check-toolchain                 # confirm the LLVM toolchain is coherent
```

### Step 1 — Get the sources

```bash
curl -fsSL -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanhauser-thc/fuzzing-targets/refs/heads/master/libxml2-2.9.2.tar.gz
tar xf libxml2-2.9.2.tar.gz
cd libxml2-2.9.2
```

### Step 2 — Add the harness

Save the harness above as `harness.cc` in the `libxml2-2.9.2` directory. The
public headers live under `include/`, so it is compiled with `-I include`.

### Step 3 — Run the analysis

One command builds the library, compiles the harness, and analyzes the result:

```bash
reachability run --lang cpp \
  --project . \
  --build-cmd './configure --without-python --disable-shared && make -j"$(nproc)" && gclang++ -I include -c harness.cc -o harness.o' \
  --artifact harness.o \
  --static-libs all \
  --entry LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput \
  --out libxml2.json -v
```

What each piece does:

- **`--build-cmd`** runs under the gllvm wrappers (the driver injects
  `CC=gclang` / `CXX=gclang++`), so `./configure && make` builds `libxml2.a`
  with embedded bitcode, and `gclang++ -c harness.cc` compiles the harness to a
  bitcode-carrying object. `--without-python --disable-shared` keeps the build
  small and produces a static `.libs/libxml2.a`.
- **`--artifact harness.o`** picks the harness object as the entry-bearing input.
  (Auto-detection would otherwise prefer one of libxml2's many test executables.)
- **`--static-libs all`** merges the *full* contents of every bitcode archive in
  the tree with the harness object. This is what lets the report cover all of
  libxml2, including functions the harness never calls.
- **`--entry LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`** roots reachability at the harness. (For
  `--lang cpp` this is already a default entry; passing it is just explicit.)

> **Why `all` and not `auto`?** `auto` discovers linked archives from a linked
> binary's metadata, which a lone object file does not have. Since the harness is
> an object, `all` is the simple choice. libxml2 builds two bitcode archives —
> `libxml2.a` and a small `testdso.a` test helper — and `all` pulls in both; they
> link without conflict. If you instead link a real fuzzer binary (harness +
> `libxml2.a` + libFuzzer), point `--artifact` at that binary and use the default
> `--static-libs auto`, exactly like the README
> [static-library example](../README.md#a-target-that-links-a-static-library).

### Step 4 — Read the report

The run prints a one-line summary. On this machine it is:

```
reachable 1257 / defined 2467  (324 indirect-only, 1210 unreachable)  [backend=type-based]
```

- **defined (2467)** — every libxml2 function (plus the harness) in the merged
  module. Because of `--static-libs all`, this is the whole library, not just the
  parts the harness pulls in.
- **reachable (1257)** — the subset reachable from `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
- **unreachable (1210)** — `defined − reachable`, everything the harness can
  never touch (listed in `not_reached.txt`).
- **indirect-only (324)** — reachable functions reached *only* through an
  indirect call. This is the over-approximation surface.

**Reachable** — the parser and everything it pulls in, since `xmlReadMemory`
drives a full parse: `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`, `xmlReadMemory`,
`xmlParseDocument`, the lexer and SAX callbacks, `xmlFreeDoc`, `xmlCleanupParser`.

The harness's `ignore` handler is reachable too — **via an indirect edge**. The
harness takes its address (`&ignore`) and hands it to `xmlSetGenericErrorFunc`;
libxml2 later calls the installed handler through a function pointer. The
type-based backend sees an address-taken function whose type matches that call
site and adds the edge. Because `ignore` is a C++ function, it appears under its
mangled name:

```json
{
  "mangled": "_Z6ignorePvPKcz",
  "demangled": "ignore(void*, char const*, ...)",
  "via": "indirect",
  "indirect_only": true
}
```

A directly-reached function carries its source location:

```json
{
  "mangled": "xmlReadMemory",
  "demangled": "xmlReadMemory",
  "file": "parser.c",
  "line": 15376,
  "via": "direct",
  "indirect_only": false
}
```

(`via` is `direct`, `indirect`, or `both`.)

**Unreachable** (`not_reached.txt`) — the large parts of libxml2 the harness
never enters: the XPath evaluator (`xmlXPathEval`, `xmlXPathCompile`),
schema/RelaxNG validation (`xmlSchemaValidateDoc`, `xmlRelaxNGValidateDoc`), and
the serialization/writer API (`xmlSaveFile`, `xmlTextWriterStartDocument`).
Before `--static-libs all`, these would have been *absent* from the analysis
entirely; now they are correctly reported as defined-but-unreachable.

> **Over-approximation in action.** Some helpers *look* reachable through the
> type-based backend even when their feature is not. For example `xmlXPathEval`
> is unreachable, yet the XPath axis callbacks (`xmlXPathNextAncestor`, …) are
> reported reachable `via indirect`: they are address-taken and their type
> matches an indirect call site the parser reaches. This is the sound-leaning
> bias at work — never miss a real edge, even at the cost of some false ones. A
> more precise backend (`--backend=svf`) narrows it.

### Step 5 — Instrument only reachable code

Feed either list to clang so SanitizerCoverage instruments just the code the
harness can reach — smaller binaries and faster fuzzing:

```bash
# instrument ONLY reachable functions:
clang -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc-guard -fsanitize-coverage-allowlist=reached.txt ...
# OR: instrument everything EXCEPT unreachable functions:
clang -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc-guard -fsanitize-coverage-ignorelist=not_reached.txt ...
```

### Troubleshooting

- **`gclang: not found` during the build.** Put gllvm on `PATH`
  (`export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"`).
- **`--static-libs all` fails to link** with a "symbol multiply defined" error.
  That happens only when two archives in the tree define the same symbol.
  libxml2's two archives (`libxml2.a`, `testdso.a`) do not collide, so it works
  here; if your tree has archives that *do* overlap, build a fuzzer binary and
  use `--static-libs auto` instead (see Step 3).
- **`configure` fails on a very new system.** libxml2-2.9.2 predates current
  toolchains; the analyzer never treats warnings as errors, but if configure
  itself errors, add the flags the project needs (e.g. `--without-lzma`) to the
  `--build-cmd`.

## 2. The `url` crate + a ziggy harness (Rust)

Now the Rust path. The [ziggy](https://github.com/srlabs/ziggy) repository ships
an example harness that fuzzes the real `url` crate from several angles
(`examples/url/src/main.rs`). Its fuzz loop lives inside `fn main()`:

```rust
fn main() {
    ziggy::fuzz!(|data: &[u8]| {
        if let Ok(string) = std::str::from_utf8(data) {
            invariant_fuzz(string);      // url::Url::parse, then assert an invariant
            differential_fuzz(string);   // parse two ways, compare
            correctness_fuzz(string);
            consistency_fuzz(string);
            idempotency_fuzz(string);
        }
    });
}
```

A ziggy harness has **no `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`** — the entry is the Rust
`main`. `--lang ziggy` acquires the Rust bitcode and roots there automatically.

### Prerequisites

A built analyzer and a recent **nightly** rustc/cargo. The analyzer's LLVM must
be at least as new as rustc's (here: analyzer 22, rustc 21.1.1 — fine).
`reachability check-toolchain` confirms it.

### Step 1 — Get the harness

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srlabs/ziggy
cd ziggy
```

### Step 2 — Run the analysis

```bash
# url-fuzz is a workspace member, so cargo would write its bitcode to the
# workspace target dir; keep it next to the crate so the driver finds it:
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/examples/url/target"

reachability run --lang ziggy --project examples/url --out url.json -v
```

What happens:

- **`--lang ziggy`** builds with `RUSTFLAGS="--emit=llvm-bc …"`, collects the
  per-crate `.bc` from `target/debug/deps/`, merges them, and roots at `main`.
- **`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`** — because `examples/url` is a member of ziggy's
  workspace, cargo would otherwise emit bitcode into the *workspace* `target/`,
  not `examples/url/target/`, where the driver looks. Pointing it at the crate's
  own `target/` keeps the two in sync. (A standalone crate needs no such step.)

For more on the ziggy shape and its caveats, see [`ziggy.md`](ziggy.md).

### Step 3 — Read the report

The summary on this machine:

```
reachable 11739 / defined 17428  (456 indirect-only, 5689 unreachable)  [backend=type-based]
```

**Rooting at the Rust `main`.** The token `main` resolves to *two* symbols, shown
in the JSON `entries`:

```json
"entries": ["main", "_ZN8url_fuzz4main17h58c435803ec45a52E"]
```

The first is the C-ABI shim that starts the Rust runtime; the second is the real
`url_fuzz::main` holding the `ziggy::fuzz!` body. Rooting at the bare token finds
both, so reachability is complete — you never type a mangled symbol. (Rooting at
only the C shim would reach almost nothing, since the real work hangs off
`url_fuzz::main`.)

**Reachable** — the harness and the `url` parser it drives: `url_fuzz::main`, all
five strategies (`invariant_fuzz`, `differential_fuzz`, `correctness_fuzz`,
`consistency_fuzz`, `idempotency_fuzz`), and `url::ParseOptions::parse` with the
parser internals beneath it.

**Unreachable** (`not_reached.txt`) — API the harness never calls. A clean
example: the harness only *parses* URLs, so the whole mutation API is
unreachable — `url::Url::set_scheme`, `set_host`, `set_port`, and the other 16
`Url::set_*` setters. Much of the Unicode/IDNA machinery (`icu_*`, `zerovec`) and
the proc-macro crates (`proc_macro2`, parts of `syn`) are unreachable too.

> **Over-approximation is heavier in Rust.** The reachable count is large
> (11,739 of 17,428) because Rust dispatches pervasively through trait-object
> vtables. The type-based backend treats every address-taken function whose
> signature matches a reached indirect call site as a candidate, so once any
> `Debug::fmt`-shaped call is reachable, same-shaped `fmt` impls across
> dependencies (much of `syn`, parts of `icu_*`) are pulled in as well. That is
> the sound-leaning bias: it never drops a real edge. The `indirect-only` count
> (456) measures functions reached *only* this way.

## 3. rustyknife + a cargo-afl harness (Rust)

[rustyknife](https://github.com/zerospam/rustyknife) is an email-parsing library
with a cargo-afl harness at `src/bin/fuzz_mailbox.rs`. Like ziggy, a cargo-afl
harness puts the fuzz loop in `main`, so reachability roots at the Rust `main`
(the `--lang afl` shape):

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate afl;

fn main() {
    fuzz!(|data: &[u8]| {
        let _ = rustyknife::rfc5321::mailbox::<rustyknife::behaviour::Intl>(data);
    });
}
```

Two things differ from the `url` walkthrough, so this one uses the **manual
route** — emit bitcode, `llvm-link`, then run the analyzer directly (the same
path [`ziggy.md`](ziggy.md) describes for projects that need custom build flags):

- The `fuzz_mailbox` bin is **feature-gated** (`required-features = ["fuzz"]`),
  so it builds only with `cargo build --features fuzz`.
- rustyknife pins the **old `afl` 0.8** crate, whose bundled AFL does not compile
  on current toolchains. We need only the bitcode, not AFL's runtime, so we nudge
  its build past two checks.

### Step 1 — Get it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zerospam/rustyknife
cd rustyknife
```

### Step 2 — Emit the bitcode

`afl` 0.8 builds a 2020-era AFL that trips a modern compiler's x86 self-test and
its `-Werror`. Skip the first with `AFL_NO_X86=1`, and defeat the second with
tiny compiler wrappers that append `-Wno-error` (any method works — the C runtime
is irrelevant to reachability):

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/nowerror
for t in cc clang clang++; do
  printf '#!/bin/sh\nexec /usr/bin/%s "$@" -Wno-error\n' "$t" > /tmp/nowerror/$t
  chmod +x /tmp/nowerror/$t
done
export PATH="/tmp/nowerror:$PATH" CC=/tmp/nowerror/cc AFL_NO_X86=1

RUSTFLAGS="--emit=llvm-bc -Cembed-bitcode=yes -Ccodegen-units=1" \
  cargo build --features fuzz --bin fuzz_mailbox
```

The final link fails (`undefined reference to __afl_manual_init` — AFL runtime
symbols added only by `cargo afl build`); that is expected under `--emit=llvm-bc`.
Only the per-crate `.bc` in `target/debug/deps/` matter, and they are now there.

### Step 3 — Link and analyze

```bash
llvm-link-22 target/debug/deps/*.bc -o merged.bc     # one .bc per crate; clean deps/ first if you rebuilt
reachability-analyzer merged.bc --entry main \
  --out afl.json --reached-out reached.txt --not-reached-out not_reached.txt
```

(`reachability-analyzer` is the built binary or `$REACHABILITY_ANALYZER`;
`llvm-link-22` is the LLVM tool matching the analyzer's major.)

### Step 4 — Read the report

```
reachable 2217 / defined 17000  (79 indirect-only, 14783 unreachable)  [backend=type-based]
```

As with ziggy, `--entry main` resolves to both the C-ABI shim and the real Rust
main — `entries: ["main", "_ZN12fuzz_mailbox4main17h…E"]`.

**Reachable** — a tight slice: `fuzz_mailbox::main` → `afl::fuzz` → the closure →
`rustyknife::rfc5321::mailbox`, and the `nom` parser combinators beneath it
(~150 `nom` functions, plus rfc5321 grammar rules such as `dot_string`).

**Unreachable** — rustyknife's *other* parsers, which this harness never calls:
the RFC 5322 message grammar (`rustyknife::rfc5322::*`) and the RFC 2047
encoded-word decoder (`rustyknife::rfc2047::decode_text`). The harness targets
only the RFC 5321 mailbox grammar, and the report reflects exactly that.

> **A focused harness yields a focused report.** Only 2,217 of 17,000 functions
> are reachable, just 79 of them indirect-only. Because the harness funnels
> through a single parser entry, the over-approximation stays small — a sharp
> contrast with the `url` example (67% reachable), where pervasive trait-object
> dispatch pulled in far more.
