"""C / C++ bitcode acquisition via gllvm.

Build the project with the gclang/gclang++ wrappers (which embed bitcode-path
metadata into each object), then run get-bc on the built artifact to extract a
whole-program .bc. The artifact is auto-detected from the build output when not
given explicitly. Independent of the project's own LTO setup.

When the build command is auto-detected (no explicit --build-cmd), it also forces
a static build wherever the build system allows it, because shared libraries are
built and linked separately and their bitcode never reaches the target. See
detect_build_cmd for the per-build-system flags.

Static-library expansion: a linked binary only embeds the archive members the
linker actually pulled in, so functions in unreferenced members of a static
library would otherwise be invisible to the analysis. With static_libs="auto"
(the default), each static archive the target links is additionally extracted in
full (get-bc -b) and merged with the target's own (non-archive) objects, so every
function in the library is classified reachable/unreachable rather than silently
dropped. "none" keeps only the linker's view; "all" pulls in every bitcode
archive found in the tree, save those whose members are already covered by a
larger one. Merging the full archive with the target's *non-archive* objects (its
manifest minus the archive members) avoids duplicate definitions. Archive manifests
provide exact object provenance; incomplete extraction falls back atomically to the
linker's view.

    gllvm wrappers are injected via CC/CXX, which every build system below
    honours at configure time, so the chosen command embeds bitcode regardless.

    Shared libraries are problematic for the analysis: a `.so` is built and
    linked separately, so its bitcode never lands in the target and get-bc cannot
    reach it (only static archives are expanded later). So the auto-detected
    command forces a static build wherever the build system supports it:
    `--disable-shared`/`--enable-static` for an existing `configure` (each added
    only if `configure --help` lists it), `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` for CMake,
    and `--default-library=static` for Meson -- both unconditional, being
    built-in toggles those tools always accept. The autotools-bootstrap paths add
    `--disable-shared --enable-static` directly, since the configure they
    regenerate does not exist yet to probe and autoconf only warns (never errors)
    on options it does not recognize. Plain make/ninja trees have no portable
    static toggle and are left untouched. An explicit `--build-cmd` bypasses all
